<p>Greetings {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME|default('friend', true) }},</p>

<p>I hope this message reaches you well! <a href="https://seagl.org/">SeaGL</a>, the Seattle GNU/Linux conference, is hosting its 13th annual conference on November 7-8th. Our attendees tend to be university students, open-source hobbyists, engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more.</p>

<p>We were looking for potential sponsors, and we came across your company since you were local to our area! If possible, can you please forward this email to your sponsors/community outreach team? We would like to know if your organization would want to support our mission of growing a community of free/libre/open (FLO) enthusiasts. For more details, we have provided a link to our <a href="https://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Partnership_Sponsor_Prospectus_2025.pdf">prospectus</a>.</p>

<p>If you can't sponsor now, please help by sharing our call-for-presentations (CfP), which is open through June 15; and posting flyers at a bulletin board, lunchroom, or other community spot.</p>
