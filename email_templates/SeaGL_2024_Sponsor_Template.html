<p>Good day {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME|default('friend', true) }},</p>

<p>I hope this message reaches you well!</p>

<p>SeaGL, the Seattle GNU/Linux conference (https://seagl.org), is holding its twelfth annual conference on November 8-9th.</p</p>

<p>This year we will be bringing back in-person activities, as well as virtual ones, to continue including our growing community of free/libre/open (FLO) enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Given this shift, we are trying to reach out to new potential sponsors, especially local ones that utilize Linux or other FLO software.</p>

<p>We would love to chat with {{ ORG_NAME }} about joining our effort to create a space where tech-savvy folks, newcomers, enthusiasts, and all users of free software can come together to learn and connect.</p>

<p>More information can be found in this year's prospectus.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else, within {{ ORG_NAME }}, or another FLOSS friendly organization that I should reach out to.</p>

<p>Finally, we've designed a few fliers and would appreciate distribution anywhere you think they might find interested folks.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your time.</p>

<p>~ {{ SENDER_FIRST_NAME }} and the Seattle GNU/Linux Team</p>
