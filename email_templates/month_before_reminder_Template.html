        <title>Checking in about {{ ORG_NAME }} as a SeaGL 2024 Sponsor?</title>

<p>Greetings {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME|default('friend', true) }},</p>

<p>I hope this message reaches you well! We reached out a few months ago about supporting <a href="https://seagl.org/" target="_blank">SeaGL</a>, the Seattle GNU/Linux Conference and we wanted to check back in now that the event is a month away.</p>

<p>As a reminder, SeaGL is hosting its 13th annual conference in Seattle on November 7-8th. Our attendees tend to be university students, open-source hobbyists, engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more. This year's keynote speakers are <a href="https://seagl.org/news/??" target="_blank">??, ??, ??, and ??</a>, and our schedule will be live shortly.</p>

<p>We are looking for values-aligned sponsors interested in supporting our mission of growing a community of free/libre/open (FLO) enthusiasts. Do you think that {{ ORG_NAME }} would be open to chatting about sponsorship/community outreach? More details about the support we are looking for can be found in our <a href="https://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Partnership_Sponsor_Prospectus_2025.pdf" target="_blank">prospectus</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else within {{ ORG_NAME }} or another FLO friendly organization that I should reach out to.</p>

<p>If you can't sponsor now, you can help by posting <a href="https://seagl.org/fliers/2025/" target="_blank">flyers</a> at a bulletin board, lunchroom, or other community spot.</p>
