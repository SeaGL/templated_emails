        <title>Checking in about {{ ORG_NAME }} as a SeaGL 2024 Sponsor?</title>

Hello {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME }},


I hope this message reaches you well! We reached out a few months ago about SeaGL and wanted to check back in now that the event is a month away.

SeaGL, the Seattle GNU/Linux conference (https://seagl.org), is holding its twelfth annual conference on November 8-9th at the University of Washington in Seattle.

We are looking for sponsors interested in connecting with free/libre/open software, hardware, and cultural communities.

Our keynotes have been announced in this <a href="https://seagl.org/news/2024/10/03/Keynotes-intro">blog post</a> and our schedule will be live shortly.

We would love to chat with {{ ORG_NAME }} about joining our effort to create a space where tech-savvy folks, newcomers, enthusiasts, and all users of free software can come together to learn and connect.

More information can be found in this year's prospectus:
https://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Partnership_Sponsor_Prospectus_2024.pdf

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else, within {{ ORG_NAME }}, or another FLOSS friendly organization that I should reach out to.

Finally, we've designed a flier and would appreciate distribution anywhere you think it might find interested folks.

If you would like to not be contacted about this conference in the future, please let us know.

Thanks so much for your time!

~ {{ SENDER_FIRST_NAME }} and the Seattle GNU/Linux Team
