Good day {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME }},

I hope this message reaches you well!

SeaGL, the Seattle GNU/Linux conference (https://seagl.org), is holding its twelfth annual conference on November 8-9th.

This year we will be bringing back in-person activities, as well as virtual ones, to continue including our growing community of free/libre/open (FLO) enthusiasts.

Given this shift, we are trying to reach out to new potential sponsors, especially local ones, that utilize Linux or other FLO software.

We would love to chat with {{ ORG_NAME }} about joining our effort to create a space where tech-savvy folks, newcomers, enthusiasts, and all users of free software can come together to learn and connect.

More information can be found in this year's prospectus:
https://seagl.org/sponsors/SeaGL_Partnership_Sponsor_Prospectus_2024.pdf

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else, within {{ ORG_NAME }}, or another FLOSS friendly organization that I should reach out to.

Finally, we've designed a few fliers and would appreciate distribution anywhere you think they might find interested folks.

Thanks so much for your time!

~ {{ SENDER_FIRST_NAME }} and the Seattle GNU/Linux Team
