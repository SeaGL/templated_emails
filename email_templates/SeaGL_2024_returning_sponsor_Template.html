Good day {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME }},

Thanks so much for sponsoring SeaGL in years past, I hope this message reaches you well!

We would love to have {{ ORG_NAME }}'s continued help supporting SeaGL and its mission to create a space where tech-savvy folks, newcomers, enthusiasts, and all users of free software can come together to learn and connect.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is someone else, within you organization or another FLOSS friendly company, I should reach out to.

Finally, we've designed a few fliers and would appreciate distribution anywhere you think they might find interested folks.
