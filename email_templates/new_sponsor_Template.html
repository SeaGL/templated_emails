<p>Greetings {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME|default('friend', true) }},</p>

<p>I hope this message reaches you well! <a href="https://seagl.org/" target="_blank">SeaGL</a>, the Seattle GNU/Linux Conference, is hosting its 13th annual conference on November 7-8th. Our attendees tend to be university students, open-source hobbyists, engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more.</p>

<p>We are looking for values-aligned sponsors and thought that {{ ORG_NAME }} would be a great fit! Would you please connect us with the best person in your organization to chat about sponsorships/community outreach?
