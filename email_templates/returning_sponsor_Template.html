<p>Greetings {{ CONTACT_FIRST_NAME|default('friend', true) }},</p>

<p>Thanks so much for sponsoring SeaGL in years past, I hope this message reaches you well! The 13th annual <a href="https://seagl.org/" target="_blank">SeaGL</a> will be held November 7-8th. Our attendees tend to be university students, open-source hobbyists, engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more.</p>

<p>We would love to have {{ ORG_NAME }}'s continued support of our mission to grow a community of free/libre/open (FLO) enthusiasts! If you are no longer the best person, could you please connect us with someone to chat with about sponsorships/community outreach?
